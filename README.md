# UST-10LX
UST-10LX LiDAR communication program for INTech's robot.

The goal of this program is to retrieve and process data information from the UST-10LX LiDAR.
The data sent to the robot is a list of obstacles with position and scale.

This LiDAR is a loan from [MADoPA association](http://www.madopa.fr/) (*French*) to [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/)

## Setup

The setup is very minimal : the interface on which the LiDAR connects must be correctly configured (192.168.0.0/24 subnet by default) and that's pretty much it!
